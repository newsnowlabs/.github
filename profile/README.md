## Our projects

### Dockside

Dockside is an open-source highly-configurable self-hosted software development environment, that lets dev teams code from anywhere in clones of their production environment and share and stage their work online for stakeholders.

Dockside lets developers provision and access lightweight, fully containerised and access-controlled IDEs, staging environments and sandboxes - aka _devtainers_ - within only a few clicks, directly from their browser.

By provisioning a devtainer for each task or branch, collaborative software and product development teams can make their lean and iterative development practices much more productive and efficient.

Dockside is free and open-source and can be hosted by anyone on-prem or in the cloud.

To learn more, see [dockside.io](https://dockside.io), view [Dockside on Github](https://github.com/newsnowlabs/dockside), and to see Dockside in action try the [Dockside Live Demo](https://www.demo.dockside.cloud/demo/).

## Docker Ingress Routing Daemon

The Docker Ingress Routing Daemon (DIRD) is a daemon that modifies the operation of Docker swarm ingress mesh routing to expose true client IPs (as opposed to load balancer node private IPs) to service containers.

DIRD implements its modifications purely through changes to routing and firewall rules, without the need for running any additional application layers (like traefik or other reverse proxies) or for reconfiguring your existing application.

DIRD is the most lightweight solution available for directly exposing client IPs within Docker service containers.

To learn more, view [DIRD on Github](https://github.com/newsnowlabs/docker-ingress-routing-daemon).
